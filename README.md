mate file-name

All command line demos are preformed on the MacOS. Creating and editing files is done with TextMate 2 (free) using the mate command from Terminal. Passing a file-name to the mate command will create or open that file. Windows users can use the notepad file-name command instead.

clear
Clears all previous commands from the terminal screen -- just a bit of clean up.
